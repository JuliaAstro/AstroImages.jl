# Displaying Images

The `imview` and `implot` functions are very similar. 
Both allow any abstract array of numbers to be rendered into an image or a Plots.jl image series.
`implot` is largely a superset of `imview` because it also supports colorbars, tick marks, WCS grid lines, overplotting other data & shapes, and automatic
axis and title naming (from the FITS header if available).

## `imview`

Any AbstractArray (including an AstroImage) can be displayed using `imview`. This function renders an
arbitrary array into an array of `RGBA` values using a number of parameters. If the input is an AstroImage{<:Number},
an AstroImage{RGBA} will be returned that retains headers, WCS information, etc.

```@setup 1
using AstroImages
using Plots

AstroImages.set_clims!(Percent(99.5))
AstroImages.set_cmap!(:magma)
AstroImages.set_stretch!(identity)
```

The defaults for the `imview` function are:
```@example 1
img = randn(50,50);
imview(img; clims=Percent(99.5), cmap=:magma, stretch=identity, contrast=1.0, bias=0.5)
```

We can adjust the color limits explicitly:
```@example 1
imview(img; clims=(-1, 1))
```

Or pass a function/callable object to calculate them for us:
```@example 1
imview(img; clims=Zscale())
```

We can turn off the colormap and use it in grayscale mode:
```@example 1
imview(img; cmap=nothing)
```

Pass any color scheme from ColorSchemes.jl:
```@example 1
imview(img; cmap=:ice)
```
```@example 1
imview(img; cmap=:seaborn_rocket_gradient)
```

Or an RGB or named color value:
```@example 1
imview(img; cmap="#F00")
imview(img; cmap="red")
```

Let's now switch to an astronomical image:
```@example 1
fname = download(
    "http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~wthompson/astroimages/fits/656nmos.fits",
    "eagle-656nmos.fits"
);
eagle = AstroImage("eagle-656nmos.fits")
```

We can apply a non-linear stretch like a log-scale, power-scale, or asinh stretch:
```@example 1
imview(eagle, stretch=asinhstretch)
```

Once rendered, we can also tweak the bias and contrast:
```@example 1
imview(eagle, stretch=asinhstretch, contrast=1.5)
```
```@example 1
imview(eagle, stretch=asinhstretch, contrast=1.5, bias=0.6)
```
These are the parameters that change when you click and drag in some applications like DS9.

Once rendered via `imview`, the resulting image can be saved in traditional image formats like PNG, JPG, GIF, etc:
```julia
save("out.png", imview(eagle, cmap=:viridis))
```

Very large Images are automatically downscaled to ensure consistent performance using `restrict` from Images.jl. This function filters the data before downscaling to prevent aliasing, so it may take a moment for truly huge images. In these cases, a faster method that doesn't prevent aliasing would be `imview(img[begin:10:end, begin:10:end])` or similar.

`imview` is called automatically on `AstroImage{<:Number}` when using a Julia environment with rich graphical IO capabilities (e.g. VSCode, Jupyter, Pluto, etc.).
The defaults for this case can be modified using `AstroImages.set_clims!(...)`, `AstroImages.set_cmap!(...)`, and `AstroImages.set_stretch!(...)`.

## Note on Views
The function `imview` has its name because it produces a "view" into the image. The result from calling `imview` is an object that lazily maps data values into RGBA colors on the fly.
This means that if you change the underlying data array, the view will update (the next time it is shown).
If you have many data files to render, you may find it faster to create a single `imview` and then mutate the data in the underlying array. This is faster since `imview` only has to resolve colormaps and compute limits once.

For example:
```julia
data = randn(100,100)
iv = imview(data)
display(iv)
data[1:50,1:50] .= 0
display(iv)
```
`iv` will reflect the changes to `data` when it is displayed the second time.

## `implot`

`implot`  is a Plots.jl recipe, which means before you can use it you first have to load `Plots.jl`:

```@example 1
using Plots
```

`implot` accepts all the arguments `imview` does for controlling how data is rendered to the screen.

```@example 1
implot(img; clims=Percent(99.5), cmap=:magma, stretch=identity, contrast=1.0, bias=0.5)
```
