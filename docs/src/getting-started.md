# Getting Started

To get started, you will first need to install AstroImages.
After starting Julia, enter package-mode by typing `]` and then
```julia-repl
pkg> add AstroImages
```

To display images and save them in traditional graphics formats like PNG, JPG, GIF, etc., you
will also need to add the `ImageIO` package. Once installed, this package doesn't need to be
loaded explicitly.


For some of the more advanced visualizations you may also want `Plots`:
```julia-repl
pkg> add Plots
```

To load the package, run:
```julia
using AstroImages
# And if desired:
using Plots
```
