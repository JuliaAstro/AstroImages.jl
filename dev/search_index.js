By default, clims=extrema i.e. the minimum and maximum of img. Convenient functions to use for clims are: extrema, zscale, and percent(p)\n\nNext, the data is rescaled to [0,1] and remapped according to the function stretch. Stretch can be any monotonic fuction mapping values in the range [0,1] to some range [a,b]. Note that log(0) is not defined so is not directly supported. For a list of convenient stretch functions, see: logstretch, powstretch, squarestretch, asinhstretch, sinhstretch, powerdiststretch\n\nFinally the data is mapped to RGB values according to cmap.

Let's show an example Now let's try and estimate the background using estimate_background. First, we'll si gma-clip to try and remove the signals from the stars. Then, the background is broken down into boxes, in this case of size (50, 50). Within each box, the given statistical estimators get the background value and RMS. By default, we use SourceExtractorBackground and StdRMS. This creates a low-resolution image, which we then need to resize.
