By default, clims=extrema i.e. the minimum and maximum of img. Convenient functions to use for clims are: extrema, zscale, and percent(p)\n\nNext, the data is rescaled to [0,1] and remapped according to the function stretch. Stretch can be any monotonic fuction mapping values in the range [0,1] to some range [a,b]. Note that log(0) is not defined so is not directly supported. For a list of convenient stretch functions, see: logstretch, powstretch, squarestretch, asinhstretch, sinhstretch, powerdiststretch\n\nFinally the data is mapped to RGB values according to cmap. If cmap is nothing, grayscale is used. ColorSchemes.jl defines hundreds of colormaps. A few nice ones for images include: :viridis, :magma, :plasma, :thermal, and :turbo.\n\nCrucially, this function returns a view over the underlying data. If img is updated then those changes will be reflected by this view with the exception of clims which is not recalculated.\n\nNote: if clims or stretch is a function, the pixel values passed in are first filtered to remove non-finite or missing values.\n\nDefaults\n\nThe default values of clims, stretch, and cmap are extrema, identity, and nothing respectively. You may alter these defaults using AstroImages.set_clims!,  AstroImages.set_stretch!, and AstroImages.set_cmap!.\n\nAutomatic Display\n\nArrays wrapped by AstroImageMat() get displayed as images automatically by calling  imview on them with the default settings when using displays that support showing PNG images.\n\nMissing data\n\nPixels that are NaN or missing will be displayed as transparent when cmap is set or black if. +/- Inf will be displayed as black or white respectively.\n\nExporting Images\n\nThe view returned by imview can be saved using general FileIO.save methods.

Ideally, we could perfectly describe the background with a scalar value or with some distribution. Unfortunately, it's impossible for us to precisely separate the background and foreground signals. Here, we use mixture of robust statistical estimators and meshing to let us get the spatially varying background from an astronomical photo. Let's show an example Now let's try and estimate the background using estimate_background. First, we'll si gma-clip to try and remove the signals from the stars. Then, the background is broken down into boxes, in this case of size (50, 50). Within each box, the given statistical estimators get the background value and RMS. By default, we use SourceExtractorBackground and StdRMS. This creates a low-resolution image, which we then need to resize. We can accomplish this using an interpolator, by default a cubic-spline interpolator via ZoomInterpolator. The end result is a smooth estimate of the spatially varying background and background RMS.","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"using AstroImages\nAstroImages.set_clims!(Percent(99.5))\nAstroImages.set_cmap!(:magma)\nAstroImages.set_stretch!(identity)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"using Photometry\nusing AstroImages\nusing Plots # optional, for implot functionality\n\n# Download our image, courtesy of astropy\nimage = AstroImage(download(\"https://rawcdn.githack.com/astropy/photutils-datasets/8c97b4fa3a6c9e6ea072faeed2d49a20585658ba/data/M6707HH.fits\"))\n\n# sigma-clip\nclipped = sigma_clip(image, 1, fill=NaN)\n\n# get background and background rms with box-size (50, 50)\nbkg, bkg_rms = estimate_background(clipped, 50)\n\nimview(image)\nimview(clipped)\nimview(bkg)\nimview(bkg_rms)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"Or, if you have Plots loaded:","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"using Plots\n\n    AstroImages.set_clims!(Percent(99.5))\n    AstroImages.set_cmap!(:magma)\n    AstroImages.set_stretch!(identity)\nplot(\n    implot(image, title=\"Original\"),\n    implot(clipped, title=\"Sigma-Clipped\"),\n    implot(bkg, title=\"Background\"),\n    implot(bkg_rms, title=\"Background RMS\"),\n    layout=(2, 2)\n)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"We could apply a median filter, too, by specifying filter_size","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"# get background and background rms with box-size (50, 50) and filter_size (5, 5)\nbkg_f, bkg_rms_f = estimate_background(clipped, 50, filter_size=5)\n\n# plot\nplot(\n    implot(bkg, title=\"Unfiltered\", ylabel=\"Background\"),\n    implot(bkg_f, title=\"Filtered\"),\n    implot(bkg_rms, ylabel=\"RMS\"),\n    implot(bkg_rms_f);\n    layout=(2, 2),)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"Now we can see our image after subtracting the filtered background and ready for Aperture Photometry!","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"subt = image .- bkg_f[axes(image)...]\nclims = extrema(vcat(vec(image), vec(subt)))\nplot(\n    implot(image; title=\"Original\", clims),\n    implot(subt; title=\"Subtracted\", clims),\n    size=(1600,1000)\n)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/#Source-Extraction","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Source Extraction","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"From the background-subtracted image, we can detect all sources in the image:","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/photometry/","page":"Extracting Photometry","title":"Extracting Photometry","text":"# We specify the uncertainty in the pixel data.
